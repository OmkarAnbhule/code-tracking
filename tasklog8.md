# React App with UI Components and State Management

This commit introduces a basic React application structure with several UI components and state management using the `useState` hook.  The app includes a `Navbar`, `Hero`, and `PopupModal` component, along with a theme provider for dark mode functionality.  A toaster component is included for displaying notifications.

## Code Overview

The `App.js` component renders the main application layout. It uses the following state variables:

* `isOpen`: Controls the visibility of a popup modal.
* `isOpened`:  Another state variable seemingly related to modal visibility. Consider refactoring for clarity.
* `preference`: Stores user preferences (likely theme or settings).
* `waiting`:  A boolean variable indicating a loading or waiting state.

The application uses a `ThemeProvider` to manage the application theme.  The components communicate through props to update the state.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import './App.css'
import Hero from './components/Hero'
import Navbar from './components/Navbar'
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/theme-provider"
import PopupModal from './components/PopupModal'
import { Toaster } from './components/ui/sonner'

function App() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [isOpened, setIsOpened] = useState(false)
  const [preference, setPreference] = useState('')
  const [waiting, setWaiting] = useState(true);

  return (
    <ThemeProvider defaultTheme="dark" storageKey="vite-ui-theme">
      <Toaster />
      <div className='w-[100%] min-h-screen '>
        <Navbar isOpened={isOpened} preference={preference} setPreference={setPreference} waiting={waiting} />
        <Hero setIsOpen={setIsOpen} isOpen={isOpened} waiting={waiting} setWaiting={setWaiting} />
        <PopupModal setPreference={setPreference} isOpen={isOpen} setIsOpen={setIsOpen} setIsOpened={setIsOpened} isOpened={isOpened} />
        Hello World Hello Hello  World
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

export default App
```

**Further Improvements:**

* **Refactor State:** The multiple state variables related to the modal (`isOpen` and `isOpened`) should be combined for better clarity and maintainability.
* **Error Handling:** Add proper error handling to prevent crashes and improve user experience.
* **Component Structure:** Consider breaking down larger components into smaller, more focused components to improve reusability and maintainability.
* **Styling:** Implement consistent and robust styling using a CSS framework or styled-components.
* **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests to ensure the app functions as expected and prevents regressions.
